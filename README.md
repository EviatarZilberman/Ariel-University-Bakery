# Ariel-University-Bakery
A code of managing a bakery. The first option to run the code is manually and the other is by threads. I have tried to contain as many options of the bakery as I know, so the user can order products, ask the baker to bake more etc. In addition, the user can run the program automatically by threads, then the threads are run run the program.
